# Topic Modeling Analysis: LSA, pLSA, and LDA

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook contains a comparative analysis of three different topic modeling techniques—Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—applied to a corpus of documents related to the Russia-Ukraine War. The goal is to identify and amplify genuine public discourse around the conflict, particularly emphasizing the human impact.

## Models Overview
- LSA: A mathematical method that helps to extract and represent the semantics of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text.
- pLSA: A probabilistic version of LSA that incorporates a statistical model to associate latent topics with documents.
- LDA: An advanced model that considers documents as mixtures of topics, which in turn are mixtures of words.
